# Reading Data In

## Financial Data

This was downloaded from Oregon department of eduction.

```{r}
DistrictFinance <- read.csv("https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/woodsjeeschools/ActualExpendituresFundFunction30.CSV") 

library(stringr)
library(dplyr)

#Convert to starting of fiscal year.  Remember that the year may not match with the test scores.
DistrictFinance$YearBeginning <- as.factor(str_sub(as.character(DistrictFinance$SchlYr),-4) )

```


```{r}

## Test data read

## Eligible schools

Not all schools are eligible.  They must be served by an IOU.  Original file has odd formating.  So, saved and accessed via gdrive.

```{r}
#Non readable because of formating to make pretty.
#read.xlsx("http://www.oregon.gov/energy/SCHOOLS/Sb1149/documents/schools_list.xls")

Eligible <- read.csv("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WXNu3cNY4DyZ7yWXT2MPd3bd61M0Vmo2ty62Uux1TZU/pub?gid=1048793783&single=true&output=csv")

```

## District demographics

Load dataframes for School performance from 2002-2016. The name for each dataframe is "Schoolxx" where xx is the last 2 digits of the ending academic year from which the data is for. The formating and the information provided in these school report cards slightly changes after 2012.   

```{r}
Schools16 <- read.csv("http://www.ode.state.or.us/data/reportcard/media/17/RCmediaSchoolsAggregate.csv")

# Linking Data

Lets get the specific data items we need for each district.  Please note that this is district level data so we need to get expenditures for all grade levels as well as construction expenditures.


```{r}
summary(DistrictFinance$FuncDesc)

```


The key fund descriptions are:


+ Plant Capital
    + Building Acquisition; Construction; and Improvement Services 
    + Facilities Acquisition and Construction 
    + Site Acquisition and Development Services

+ Operation and Maintenance of Plant Services 

+ Education Expenditures
    + English Second Language Programs 
    + High School Programs 
    + Intermediate Programs
    + Middle/Junior High Programs
    + Primary (K-3) 

Will go with the major category of instruction for Educational expenditures.

```{r}
DistrictFinance %>% 
  filter( FuncDesc == 'Building Acquisition; Construction; and Improvement Services' | FuncDesc == 'Facilities Acquisition and Construction' | FuncDesc == 'Site Acquisition and Development Services') %>% 
  mutate(ExpType = 'Capital') -> CapitalExpenditures

DistrictFinance %>% 
  filter( FuncDesc == 'Operation and Maintenance of Plant Services' ) %>%
  mutate( ExpType = 'Operations' ) -> PlantOperations

# Going for the larger Instructional Category
# 
# DistrictFinance %>% filter(FuncDesc == 'English Second Language Programs' | FuncDesc == 'High School Programs' |  FuncDesc == 'Intermediate Programs' |FuncDesc == 'Middle/Junior High Programs' | FuncDesc == 'Primary (K-3)') %>% mutate(ExpType = 'Education') -> EducationExpenditures

DistrictFinance %>% 
  filter( MajFuncDesc == 'Instruction' ) %>% 
  mutate( ExpType = 'Education' ) -> EducationExpenditures

KeyBudget <- bind_rows(list(CapitalExpenditures, PlantOperations, EducationExpenditures))


```


Turn this into a one row per district per year data frame

```{r}
library(tidyr)
KeyBudget %>% spread(FuncDesc, Amount) -> Budget

```


## Installed Measures

Lets find a range of dates that we need to work with.

```{r}
EEMs %>% summary()
```

Lets focus in on the years.

```{r}
table(EEMs$ImplementedYear)

```


There were a bunch in 2010.  If I go back to 2006 I should be ok to establish parallel movement.

Lets get a list of school districts

```{r}
EEMs %>% select(SchoolDistrictName) %>% unique()
```


We have a list of eligible and ineligible by district.

```{r}
Eligible %>% 
  select(District.ID, District.Name, SB.1149.Eligibility) %>% 
  unique()


```

Lets find these complex districts.

```{r}
Eligible %>% 
  select(District.ID, District.Name, SB.1149.Eligibility) %>% 
  unique() %>%
  group_by(District.ID, District.Name) %>%
  count() %>%
  filter(n > 1)

```




Note that some districts have schools that are both eligibile and not.  That could be a good comparision.  If there are similar schools in the same district one with and one without EEMs then we have a good comparison.
 
Lets check for installations against this list.  Because the EEM data file has a school code and not a district code, I need to merge that in.

```{r}
Eligible %>% 
  select( District.ID, District.Name, SB.1149.Eligibility ) %>% 
  unique() %>%
  group_by( District.ID, District.Name ) %>%
  count() %>%
  filter(n > 1) -> BorderDistrict

inner_join(Eligible, BorderDistrict) -> BorderSchools

inner_join(BorderSchools, EEMs, by = c("School.ID" = "FacilityODEId")) -> BorderEEM

BorderEEM
```

We have schools in that list with EEMs.

Lets get the schools with EEMs.

```{r}
BorderEEM %>%
  select(School.ID, School.Name, District.ID, District.Name, FacilityTypeDescription) %>%
  unique() -> SchoolsWEEM

SchoolsWEEM

```


We need to purge the charter and special schools.  Charter schools have charter in the name so it is easy

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)

str_detect(SchoolsWEEM$School.Name, "Charter") %>% table()

SchoolsWEEM %>% 
  mutate(Charter = str_detect(School.Name, "Charter")) %>%
  filter(Charter == FALSE) ->SchoolsWEEM


```


Now, lets see if we have schools of the same type, elementary, middle etc, within the same district that are not eligible.

```{r}
#Need to add the type of institution to the Eligible data frame
#
#


library(stringr)

Schools16 %>% 
  select(School.ID, School.Type) -> SchoolType

Eligible %>% 
  left_join(SchoolType, by = c("School.ID" = "School.ID")) -> Eligible

SchoolsWEEM %>%
  left_join(SchoolType, by = c("School.ID" = "School.ID")) -> SchoolsWEEM
  
Eligible %>% 
  filter(SB.1149.Eligibility == "NO") %>%
  right_join(SchoolsWEEM, c("District.ID"= "District.ID", "School.Type" = "School.Type")) %>%
  filter(!is.na(ESD) ) -> SameTypeBorder

SameTypeBorder


```





## District Demographics

The files are so different from year to year.  This is going to be fun.  This would be so much easier if the ODE people understood some statistics.
