# EE-and-School-Performance

Energy efficiency measures (EEMs) frequently include measures that directly improve the learning environment.  These include things like day-lighting, which increases performance on several dimensions, and new glazing, which, while rarely cost effective on the basis of energy alone, can reduce mold, outdoor noise, and reduce absenteeism.

This study will use a variety of causal identification techniques to establish if the installation of EEMs results in a measurable increase in student performance as measured by standardized tests.  Oregon's K12 funding structure, which levelizes funding per student across districts, and the requirements that state funding for EEMs in schools restricts be used in areas served by IOUs, assists in this identification.
